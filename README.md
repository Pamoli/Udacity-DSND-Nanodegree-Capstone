# Udacity-DSND-Nanodegree-Capstone

In this project, we'll analyze the data collected from an imaginary music streaming service, Sparkify, where people can listen to music as a free-tier user, in which music can be interrupted with ads, or can subscribe to a plan for uninterrupted service. The dataset provided here has some features related to the user activities on daily basis for 225 users, on the basis of which we'll try to predict which users are more likely to churn.
